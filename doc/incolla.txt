INTRODUCTION                                                      *incolla.nvim*

incolla.nvim is a plugin for seamlessly pasting images from the MacOS clipboard
into the open Neovim buffer.

A practical introduction into incolla.nvim customization is our `README.md`
(top-level of repo). To find out more:
https://github.com/mattdibi/incolla.nvim

incolla.setup({opts})                                        *incolla.setup()*
    Setup function to be run by user. Configures the defaults and the filetype
    configurations of incolla.nvim

    Usage:
    >
    require('incolla').setup{
      defaults = {
        -- Default configuration for incolla.nvim goes here:
        -- img_dir = value,
        -- ..
      },
      <filetype> = {
        -- Per-filetype configuration goes here:
        -- img_dir = value,
        -- ..
      }
    }

    You can customize the behaviour for a filetype by creating a field named
    after the desired filetype. If you're uncertain what to name your field 
    to, you can run `lua print(vim.bo.filetype)`. Missing options from 
    `<filetype>` field will be replaced by the default configuration.

                                                         *incolla.img_dir*
    img_dir: ~
        Directory where the image from clipboard will be copied to. Please
        note that it will always will be referred to the currently open
        buffer. This means that if the current open buffer is
        `/home/user/path/file.txt` and the `img_dir` is set to `imgs`,
        the image will be saved to `/home/user/path/imgs/<name>`.


                                                        *incolla.img_name*
    img_name: ~
        Function used to determine image's name when it will be saved on
        disk. The function **must** return a string. Please note that if the
        clipboard content is a file URL, the original filename will be used.

                                                           *incolla.affix*
    affix: ~
        String that sandwiches the image's path and will be written in your 
        open buffer


incolla.incolla()                                          *incolla.incolla()*
    Incolla.nvim main function. It is responsible for the main functionality
    of the plugin.

    Once called it leverages AppleScript to:
        - Retrieve informations about the clipboard content
        - Save the clipboard content on disk if it's an image. Copy the image
          to the destination directory in case is a file URL.
        - Create the destination folder if it doesn't exists
        - Update the current buffer with the image path according to the
          `affix`

COMMAND                                                 *incolla.nvim.command*

`:Incolla`                                                        *:Incolla*
    This is the command to paste image from your clipboard. It calls
    `incolla.incolla()` under the hood.
